# 3D_Leisure
A simple 3D application that draw a toy and some boxes. You can walk through the boxes, or climb to the top of hill. Â 

At the beginning of writing this program, I want to make a little game engine, but It is hard and I don't have much time.  

The terrain is load from raw file in res folder. The meshes is created in runtime. The toy is actor with frame animation.
